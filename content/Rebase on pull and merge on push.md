Rebase on pull and merge on push is a solid workflow. Here's why:

Rebase on pull:
- Keeps history linear
- Avoids unnecessary merge commits
- Easier to read and understand project history

Merge on push:
- Preserves complete history
- Safer for shared branches
- Avoids force pushes

This approach balances clean history with safe collaboration. It's generally good practice, especially for team projects. However, team agreement and consistent use are crucial for this workflow to be effective.
