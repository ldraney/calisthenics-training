[[My Calisthenics Progress]]

Welcome to my personal calisthenics progress tracker. This page documents my journey as I build strength, flexibility, and endurance through body-weight exercises. Join me as I log my workouts, track my improvements, and reflect on my experiences.

My motivation for this website is:
1. Accountability and community - I want to share my progress with others who are also interested!
2. Mentorship - I have less pain in my body, and I want to share as a source of motivation and learning for others

## My Goals
- [ ] A Baki-like body
- [ ] Finger handstand pushup
- [ ] 540 all ways on a snowboard 
- [ ] bmx - pop out of a bowl
- [ ] A tumbling routine with a split kick flip
