[[My Weekly Calisthenics Progress]]

Welcome to my personal calisthenics progress tracker. This page documents my journey as I build strength, flexibility, and endurance through body-weight exercises. Join me as I log my workouts, track my improvements, and reflect on my experiences.

My motivation for this website is two-fold:
1. Accountability - I want to take my own life to the next level. 
2. Mentorship - I have less pain in my body, and I want to share as a source of motivation and learning for others. 

Here are my own goals that are quite far-reaching, but sincere nonetheless:
- [ ] A Baki-like body
- [ ] Finger handstand pushup
- [ ] 540 all ways on a snowboard 
- [ ] bmx - pop out of a bowl
- [ ] A tumbling routine with a split kick flip

As a final thought, I am thankful for inspiration from the book "Overcoming Gravity: A Systematic Approach to Gymaistcs and BodyWeight Strength" by Steven Low.  
As Steven points out, much of what is done at the gym are beach-body exercises, which is great; but also incomplete. 
In order to have long-term lack of body pain, and to improve in personal abilities, calisthenics are fundamental.  
Calisthenics are iterative - in that as you dedicate more time and effort, exercises become more interesting, and strenght adn abilities increase. 
By abilities, i mean to have the flexibility, strength, and basic body awareness to take whatever sport you enjoy to the next level;
or, to just not be in pain during your day-to-day. 

With that being said, here is my progress week to week:
