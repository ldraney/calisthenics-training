title: Rate of percieved exertion (RPE)
---

Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) is a subjective scale used to measure the intensity of physical effort during exercise. It was originally developed by Swedish psychologist Gunnar Borg and has since been adapted for various forms of exercise, including strength training and calisthenics.

## Key Points:
- RPE typically uses a scale from 1 to 10
- It reflects the exerciser's perception of how hard they are working
- RPE can be used to gauge workout intensity and track progress over time
- It's particularly useful in bodyweight exercises where adding external resistance isn't always possible

## Common RPE Scale for Strength Training / Calisthenics:
1-2: Very light effort (warm-up)
3-4: Light effort (could do many more reps)
5-6: Moderate effort (could do a few more reps)
7-8: Hard effort (could do 1-2 more reps)
9: Very hard effort (could maybe do 1 more rep)
10: Maximum effort (couldn't do any more reps)

Using RPE allows athletes to adjust their training based on daily variations in strength and energy levels, potentially leading to more effective and safer workouts.

Consider the following example, where I give myself a range before the workout, then I report on the actual RPE afterwards.  
This helps me commit to a certain intensity without needing to overexert and potentially injure myself.

Perform 3 rounds of the following circuit, resting 1-2 minutes between rounds:

| Exercise                 | Sets | Reps | RPE (Options) | RPE (Example) | Notes                            |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ---- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Pull-ups                 | 3    | 8    | 6-9           | 8             | Challenging but manageable       |
| Push-ups                 | 3    | 15   | 5-8           | 6             | Felt relatively easy             |
| Pistol squats (per leg)  | 3    | 8    | 7-9           | 9             | Very difficult, barely completed |
| Dips                     | 3    | 10   | 6-8           | 7             | Moderate difficulty              |
| Hanging leg raises       | 3    | 15   | 6-9           | 8             | Core was burning                 |
| Planche progression hold | 3    | 30s  | 7-10          | 10            | Maximum effort to hold position  |
